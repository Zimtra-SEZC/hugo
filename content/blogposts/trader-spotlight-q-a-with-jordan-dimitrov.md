With over seven years of trading experience in U.S. equities and fixed income, Jordan Dimitrov has turned market challenges into a successful career. Last year, he co-founded [Yield Dynamics Trading Group](https://ydgtrading.com/) with Vladimir Sorchev, building a thriving community in Bulgaria that helps traders master the markets from the ground up.

* **Jordan, first things first. Big congratulations on the arrival of your baby girl! How has fatherhood impacted your approach to trading and life in general?**

  Thank you! Becoming a father has been a life-changing experience. It’s brought a new sense of responsibility and purpose to everything I do, including trading. I want to be more disciplined and focused than ever, as I want to set an example for my daughter. Fatherhood has also helped me appreciate the importance of balance—ensuring I allocate time for both my family and my trading career. It’s a powerful motivator to push for even greater success while maintaining stability.
* **What do you enjoy outside of trading? Do you have any hobbies or activities that help you unwind and maintain balance in your life?**

  Outside of trading, I enjoy spending quality time with my family, especially now with my daughter. I also like to stay active—whether it’s hitting the gym, going for long walks, or playing sports. Physical activity helps me clear my mind and recharge. Additionally, I have a keen interest in reading and learning new things, particularly in areas that help me grow both as a trader and as a person.
* **What sparked your initial interest in trading and how did you evolve into the experienced trader you are today?**

  My interest in trading was sparked by the sheer excitement of the markets and the potential for financial independence. Back in 2017, I started with very little knowledge, but I was determined to learn. It wasn’t an easy road—I’ve faced numerous ups and downs, including periods of significant equity swings. However, those difficult moments taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of having a solid strategy. Over time, I built a deeper understanding of market dynamics and honed my skills, evolving into the trader I am today.
* **Could you share some key principles that continue to define your trading strategy?**

  Absolutely. Here are some principles I live by:

  \-  Risk Management is Key: Always protect your capital first. No trade is worth risking your long-term success. That is a principle that I know from theory but took me years and even now I'm trying to improve on it.

  \- Consistency Over Perfection: Success comes from executing a proven strategy consistently, not chasing perfection or getting every trade right.

  \- Adaptability: The market is ever-changing, so you need to remain flexible and open to adjusting your strategies when needed.

  \- Emotional Discipline: Trading can be emotional, but staying calm and sticking to your plan is crucial for long-term success.
* **Yield Dynamics Trading Group has made a strong mark in Bulgaria. What motivated you to build this community and what’s your vision for its future?**

  YD Trading was born out of a desire to give back to the trading community and help aspiring traders achieve success. My partner Vladimir and I saw the need for a place in Bulgaria where people could learn trading from the ground up, with real mentorship and support. Our vision is to create a robust community of skilled traders who are not only profitable but also disciplined and knowledgeable. Over time, we hope to expand YD Trading’s reach and influence across Europe and beyond.
* **You’ve been with Zimtra for many years now - what makes Zimtra stand out from others?**

  Zimtra is exceptional because of its commitment to its traders. The company provides outstanding tools, resources, and support to help traders succeed. They foster a culture of learning and innovation, which aligns perfectly with my own values. Zimtra’s ability to adapt to market trends and prioritize the needs of its traders is what sets it apart. Many times in hard periods Zimtra always reacts as your bigger brother and stays beside us!
* **What advice would you give to traders who are just starting their journey with Zimtra?**

  My advice is to focus on the fundamentals and not rush the process. Trading is a marathon, not a sprint. Start by mastering risk management and developing a solid strategy. Stay disciplined and patient—it takes time to build consistency. Also, take full advantage of the resources and support Zimtra offers. Surround yourself with like-minded people who will motivate you to grow, and never stop learning. With a business partner like Zimtra behind your back, your opportunities are endless. WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR ENORMOUS THANKS TO THE WHOLE TEAM ! They are just amazing.
