With over two decades of trading experience, author of [Cash Rules: Reminiscences Of a Stock Trader](https://www.david-hale.com/book), David Hale has navigated the highs and lows of the market, transforming a passion for gambling into a disciplined and highly successful trading career. 

After 12 loyal years trading with Zimtra, he’s the perfect guest to feature next under the spotlight.

1. As someone with an interest in gambling, how do you separate trading as a skill-based profession rather than a gamble?

Gambling typically means that the house has the edge, not you, so trading should never be confused with gambling. If I don’t have a strategy with an edge and then execute it effectively, I am gambling. Gambling is about the thrill, and while I still get a buzz from trading, the ultimate buzz comes from executing my trading plan.

2. What specific steps did you take to develop the discipline needed to recover from your initial $40,000 loss?

The biggest step was learning to cut my losing trades and keeping those losses as small as possible. Losses are inevitable, but the number one priority for a new trader is to keep them tight and get your trading education as quickly and cheaply as possible. Cutting losses quickly will not only reduce the financial hole that you will no doubt dig yourself into at the start; even more importantly, it teaches discipline, which is a prerequisite for any successful trader.

3. How much do you think living a disciplined life outside of trading contributes to maintaining discipline in your trading?

Unfortunately, I haven't always followed this mantra, but discipline in one’s life definitely translates to better trading success. Trading can be very toxic, so it is extremely important to manage the stress and rigors in a healthy and disciplined manner.

4. Having traded since the early 2000s, what are the biggest changes you’ve observed in the markets over the years?

I wish I could go back to those good old days. The rise of automated trading has generally made my job tougher–the markets were so much more inefficient and “glitchy” back then. But although lots of the “free money” has disappeared, there are obviously still plenty of opportunities because traders are making a lot more money today than back then.
