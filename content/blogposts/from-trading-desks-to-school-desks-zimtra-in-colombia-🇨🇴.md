*At Zimtra, weâ€™ve always been committed to helping our customers: Trade the Advantage. But during our recent trip to MedellÃ­n, we had a rare opportunity to extend that mindset far beyond the markets.*

## **Stocks Trading Summit ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´**

Traders packed out MedellÃ­n for a fantastic trading event with Edu Trades, Tim Sykes, Sang Lucci, Kyle Williams & David Hanlin, full of knowledge sharing.

But what we saw beyond the venue hit different.

One local school has a dream: to knock down the walls of an aging classroom and rebuild it into something better.

The goal?

To make room for 50 more students each term, and turn the space into a fully renovated, interactive classroom powered by solar energy - a place built for learning, sustainability, and long-term impact.

## **Laying the first bricks**

The first bricks are already in place to turn this old room into an interactive classroom, but FundaciÃ³n Solidaridad por Colombia could still use your help.
