We reached out to Ignacio "Nacho" Vitale Martinelli, one of Zimtra’s standout live-funded traders, to get his take on his trading journey, the challenges he’s faced, and his advice for fellow traders. Here’s what he shared with us:

### What do you enjoy most about trading?

What I enjoy most about trading is the constant challenge. Every day is different, and each new obstacle is an opportunity to learn. Navigating through the various market cycles is incredibly satisfying; it reaffirms that I'm in a flow state, not just in trading but in life itself, as trading mirrors life.

### What challenges have you faced in trading?

The challenges I've faced are numerous, with new ones arising almost daily, haha. During my early days as a trainee, I struggled particularly with stock selection. I was more of a 'machine gunner' than a 'sniper', which led to taking many unnecessary losses. However, these experiences shaped me over time. Each past pain has transformed into subconscious knowledge; not just through the notes I took, but through the experiences themselves, which have honed my trading edge.

### What advice would you give to beginner traders?

My advice would be to TAG EVERYTHING. You need to categorize your trades. Without categorization, you'll never pinpoint where you excel or where you need improvement. Gut feeling is great as it's your subconscious speaking, but it should be backed by raw data to validate and accelerate your learning process. Also another advice would be to surround yourself with like-minded and hungry people, other go-getters.

### Any books or tools you’d recommend?

The most impactful book I've read is "Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Although it's not strictly a trading book, its principles apply wonderfully to trading and life in general.

### Would you like to share any memorable stats, such as your best or most exciting trade?

My trading stats might not be flashy, but I'm a very consistent trader who doesn't typically experience extreme highs or lows. My strength lies in consistency and adaptability to market cycles.
