          <div class="blog-content">
            <p class="blogpost-body-2"><img src="/blogposts/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Juan Cálad is an <strong>international negotiator and educator</strong> with over a decade in the markets. From working at the Colombian Stock Exchange to teaching at top universities, Juan has combined institutional experience with a passion for teaching and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Today, he’s the <strong>CEO of <a href="https://up-trading.com/">UP Trading</a></strong>, an investment academy helping traders across 22+ countries and he’s found his edge in shorting small-cap stocks with a data-driven approach.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Read on to learn how Juan built his advantage, why trading psychology starts with probability, and how he turned years of trial and error into consistent success.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>1. You’ve been trading for over a decade, worked in institutions like the Colombian Stock Exchange and have experience as a university professor. How have these experiences shaped your approach to both trading and teaching?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">For me, my entire learning process has been quite an adventure. I was hired by the Colombian Stock Exchange in 2013, which gave me access to a wide network of investors both local and international. Thanks to this, I learned about investing and this fuelled the passion that still fills me today.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">As part of my job, I traveled to major universities like the University of the Andes, Externado, ICESI, and University of Rosario to give talks and promote a trading game called <em>Bolsa Millonaria,</em> where you operate a demo account and the winner takes money and trips all supported by the Colombian Stock Exchange. That’s when I really found my passion because it was not just about promoting a game but also I had to talk about technique and ways to win the game - charts, stats, company analysis and financial statements. I got certified by the exchange, and a few years later, I was teaching subjects like International Stock Exchange Markets at universities in Pereira. That blend of academic and market experience shaped both how I trade and how I teach others.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>2. You’ve traded across multiple asset classes, from stocks and currencies to commodities and crypto. What led you to focus primarily on US equities?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Adaptability and flexibility has always been my strength. I started with the Colombian stock market, which taught me a lot about Level 2 reading, as it is a very illiquid market that moves an average of $35 million in daily volume. But I eventually moved to Forex, where I learned technical analysis and worked with lots of indicators. I made some money but also took some big losses due to poor risk management.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Then I heard about a local group trading US stocks. I visited their office, and everything clicked. They were trading opening gaps on a floor with real structure and discipline. I dove in—read books, took courses, and applied everything I’d learned so far. Then the Crypto Boom came, and I decided to buy BTC and learn about all the altcoins. This investment gave me excellent returns in a year, and I honestly expected more ;)</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Eventually, I found small caps through Tim Sykes and decided to give that niche a shot. It’s been a pleasant surprise. Every asset class gave me tools: Crypto taught me to capitalize on hype, Forex sharpened my chart reading, and stocks brought it all together through solid analysis.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>3. What’s working for you as a trader right now? Are there specific patterns, strategies or market conditions you thrive in?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">I’m a short seller focused on small caps. My edge lies in spotting deficient companies with pre-market movements greater than 50%, which allows me to search for a short during regular hours. These types of companies have poor results, are dilutive and statistically have an advantage in their favour in prolonged falls until the close.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>4. Finding an advantage is key to long-term success. How did you discover yours and what adjustments did you make along the way to refine your approach?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Mainly, it&rsquo;s about finding an advantage in every trade I make, and then developing the discipline and mindset to follow my patterns.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">A second point would be reducing losses, not getting emotionally attached to any trade and just being objective. If I have to take a loss, I take it and don&rsquo;t fight it, I know another set up will give me a higher return.  I just wait for the right conditions, and when they come, I go in fully focused.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>5. UP TRADING is becoming a well-known name in the trading education space. What inspired you to start it, and what’s your vision for its future?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Honestly, I never set out to build an academy. My main goal from day one was always to become consistently profitable. Throughout this journey of over 12 years, friends and colleagues began asking me to share what I was learning. That turned into UP TRADING.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Since 2014, our programs have reached traders in over 22 countries. Today, we’re focusing heavily on small caps and growing a tighter, more specialized community. We’ve built a live trading room where I share my trades daily, and that community is growing fast.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>6. Trading psychology plays a huge role in success. What mental frameworks or habits have helped you stay disciplined and consistent over the years?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Psychology starts with having an edge. You can meditate and stay calm, but if your system has no probability, your account is still in trouble. For me, confidence comes from data-backed trades.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Beyond that, I stay disciplined, accept losses, and view trading as a game of probabilities. The more objective you are, the longer you last.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>7. Many new traders struggle with information overload. If you had to break down trading success into three key principles, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Advantage (Probability)</strong>: Rely on a system supported by past data to make future decisions.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Money Management:</strong> Maintain a healthy relationship between your profits and losses, whether through successful investments or through maximizing trades. &ldquo;Earn more and lose less.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Self-Evaluation</strong>: What I&rsquo;m doing well and what can I improve, be aware of my decisions, and keep a journal.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>8. You’ve been part of the Zimtra community for a while now, what made you stay with us?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Zimtra is simply the best option out there for traders like me. The commissions are unbeatable, support is excellent, and the low deposit requirements make it perfect for building a community of new traders.</p>
