<p class="blogpost-body-2">Meet <strong>Doug Gonzalez</strong>, a passionate trader based in Colombia who believes that success in the markets comes from continuous learning and a strong community.</p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Join us as we dive into his journey, insights, and the key principles that drive his success!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Tell us a little about yourself. Outside of trading, what do you enjoy doing?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Aside from trading, I work as a business consultant for a tech company, helping clients in places like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina. It&rsquo;s been a great experience, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot. But honestly, what I love most is spending time with my family and my little one, who&rsquo;s two now. We&rsquo;re always exploring new spots around the city and going on adventures, which is a ton of fun. We&rsquo;re also big fans of traveling!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>What do you enjoy most about trading?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">I really enjoy trading. Whenever I can, I dedicate at least three or four hours to it, sometimes even more. What I like most is that I’ve found a way to build something for myself, to have my own business. It only depends on me, and it’s a skill I can use anywhere, anytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>What’s working for you as a trader right now? Are there specific patterns, strategies, or market conditions you prefer?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">What&rsquo;s really helped me is trying to go with the flow of the market as much as possible. I tend to lean towards shorts a bit more, but a few weeks ago, everything was running, and breakouts were the way to go—so I jumped on that. Now that a lot of stocks are dropping, I’m taking advantage and going short. So, what I think works best is <em>not</em> fighting the market but just going with the trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Finding your advantage is key to long-term success. How did you discover yours, and what adjustments did you make along the way to refine your approach?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">I think this profession is all about continuous learning. You have to keep going every day and never take trading education for granted. It really helps to have a mentor or coach and a strong community that supports you through the good times and the bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Many new traders struggle with information overload. If you had to break down trading success into three key principles, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Three things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="blogpost-body-2">Focus on one thing at a time and try to master it.</li>
<li class="blogpost-body-2">Keep studying. Fundamentals, technical analysis, everything is important.</li>
<li class="blogpost-body-2">Have a mentor. It’s so much easier when you have someone to guide you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Bonus:</strong> Have the right mindset and always respect your risk. Keep FOMO away!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Would you like to share any memorable stats, such as your best or most exciting trade?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Well I can’t remember one specific trade, but I do remember the feeling of the first time I made my day with just one single trade on one stock. At that moment, you start to realize that success in this profession is possible, and that feeling gives you the fuel to keep going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>You’ve been part of the Zimtra community for a while now. What made you stay with us?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">Zimtra is a fantastic prop firm, and my experience has been really positive. From the start, opening my account was easy and fast. I appreciate the transparency in their results, fees, and commissions. The support team is super responsive, and the locate prices are excellent. I think all these things set Zimtra apart, and I’d encourage new traders to join this awesome community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="blogpost-body-2"><strong>Zimtra is hosting an <a href="https://zimtra.com/medellin25/">exciting event with Stocks Trading Club</a> in Medellín soon. Why are events like this important for the community, and why should traders attend?</strong></p>
<p class="blogpost-body-2">I’m part of the Stock Trading Club community, and I’m 100% positive that it’s the best group of traders out there. We&rsquo;ve got the top Spanish-speaking coach (<em>EduTrades!</em>). Going to these events is a <em>killer</em> opportunity to connect with other traders in your city who are on the same journey as you. Plus, you learn so much from the guest speakers and get a better grip on how this whole world works. Seriously, it’s an experience that levels you up and you go home pumped and ready to crush it!</p>
