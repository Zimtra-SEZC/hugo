From long shifts in a London kitchen to hitting six figures in trading profits, **Fernando Diaz’s** journey is nothing short of inspiring. Like many traders, he started with the dream of financial freedom, but the road to success wasn’t easy.

In this month’s **Trader Spotlight**, Fernando shares the key lessons that shaped his trading career, the strategies that are working for him right now, and why he never misses a trading event.

**1. Tell us a little about yourself. Outside of trading, what do you enjoy doing?**

My name is Fernando, I’m 31 years old, and I live in Spain. I discovered trading about seven years ago while living in London, working 12-hour shifts as a kitchen porter for £1,400 a month. I knew I didn’t want that life forever, so I started studying everything I could about trading. It took me three years to become a consistently profitable trader, thanks in large part to Edu Trades, who taught me most of what I know about small-cap trading. By my fourth year, I started seeing real results, and in 2024, I hit six figures in trading profits. Now, in 2025, I expect it to be an even better year.

**2. What do you enjoy most about trading?**

I originally got into trading thinking it would be an easy way to make quick money, but I quickly realized that was not the case. The journey was tough, but I fell in love with the process. What I enjoy most about trading is the freedom it provides. I can trade from anywhere in the world, and I have the ability to support my family financially. But more than that, I truly value the people I’ve met along the way—trading has introduced me to some incredible individuals who have become lifelong friends.

**3. What’s working for you as a trader right now? Are there specific patterns, strategies, or market conditions you prefer?**

Right now, I consider myself more of a systematic trader, although I also trade discretionarily. About 80% of my profits come from systematic trading. I’m not a quant, I don’t know how to code, and I don’t even use spreadsheets! But thanks to the Flash Research app, I’ve been able to build a portfolio of fully systematic strategies.

I wouldn’t call myself a short seller, but all my systematic strategies are short-focused. However, in my discretionary trading, I love going long on stocks with strong momentum.

**4. Finding your advantage is key to long-term success. How did you discover yours, and what adjustments did you make along the way to refine your approach?**

Finding an edge in trading could be an entire podcast episode in itself! But to put it simply, the fastest way to find an edge is to learn from someone who is already profitable. In my case, I learned from Edu, who taught me the Penny Stock Framework and the specific patterns he trades.

From there, I adapted his strategies into a systematic approach with fixed rules and no subjectivity. My strategies are based on trading stocks that are financially weak and tend to fade after overextending. It’s a simple concept, but it works.

**5. Many new traders struggle with information overload. If you had to break down trading success into three key principles, what would they be?**

* **Learn from someone who is already profitable.** You’ll drastically shorten your learning curve if you follow someone who can prove they make money and trades live so you can see their process in action. It might cost money, but it’s absolutely worth it.
* **Go all in—no plan B.** If you want to become a trader, you need to give it everything you’ve got. Study harder than anyone else, make more sacrifices than anyone else. This is a highly competitive field, and nobody will hand you success. You have to put in the hours.
* **Surround yourself with people who are better than you.** Being part of a group of traders who push you to improve is invaluable. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my trading buddies.

**6. Would you like to share any memorable stats, such as your best or most exciting trade?**

The beauty of trading is how quickly things can become exponential. In just the first three months of 2025, I’ve already made as much as I did in all of 2024. Watching those numbers grow exponentially is incredible.

My best trade so far was on the ticker **$TNXP**, where I made five figures in a single trade.

**7. You’ve been part of the Zimtra community for a while now. What made you stay with us?**

What I appreciate most about Zimtra is the team behind it. They genuinely listen to their customers and continuously work to improve their services. But what really sets them apart is their speed—whenever I need something, their response time is outstanding.

**8. Zimtra is hosting an exciting event with Stocks Trading Club in Madrid soon. Why are events like this important for the community, and why should traders attend?**

I recommend **everyone** attend events like the one with Stocks Trading Club. I personally never miss these events, and I go to as many as I can. Thanks to these events, I’ve met amazing people who have contributed massively to my growth as a trader. You never know who you might meet or how they could impact your journey.
