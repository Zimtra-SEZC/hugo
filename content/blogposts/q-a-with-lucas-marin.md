**1)    Lucas, for anyone who doesn’t know you properly — give us a quick intro.**

My name is Lucas Marin, I’m from Brazil. I´ve been a trader for the last 17 years, but only started trading in US Equities for the last 5 years. Before that, I traded only at Brazilian markets (mainly futures).

On a career level, I worked at Credit Suisse Investment Bank as an Equity Trader and had my own startup (an ecommerce). 

I became a fulltime trader in 2023 and had the joy of becoming a nomad trader for 2 years, travelling 27 countries in this period. A dream coming true.

Now, I came back home and started working at BlackArrow, the next-gen trading platform for US Markets, while still trading every single day.

**2)    You’ve mentioned having a breakthrough over the past 12 months. What actually clicked for you?** 

First, when I started full time working, I had to reevaluate my trading in terms of best setups, best sessions and stock selection. I understood that my most profitable session was After Hours, and that was perfect to match a full-time job with an active session.

Second, having a stable income that doesn’t depend on trading, made me reduce the pressure of paying bills. Now, I trade to make extra income. Thats a relief. And I got lucky enough to work with a trading related job, which is amazing and very fullfiling.

Third, since I had less trades per day, I got more focused. This made me improve risk management, and this is the big click.

**3)    How do you balance the art of part-time trading while working full-time for BlackArrow? How does that structure look?**

It looks amazing. First, working at BlackArrow made me understand the microstructure of the market, now I have meetings with brokers, exchanges, influencers and this made me improve as a trader too. But the biggest change is reducing screen time. I don’t overtrade anymore because I don’t have the free time to do it.

And as I said before, not having the pressure to make money, makes you trade to trade well, which is right approach to trading.

**4)    As your size increased, how did your approach to risk management change?**

This was the biggest turning point, trading less made me increase size. Increase size means I cannot get on a trade without knowing where to stop. At all. I always have a stop. 

Another thing that I learned is that if you take a stop, it doesn’t mean you cannot reenter. If the setup forms again, you can reenter and make the loss back. It’s always related to keep the losses as small as possible.

**5)    How has Zimtra been part of your journey — which features or packages do you use?**

Zimtra was the first player to innovate and do a partnership with BlackArrow. I’ve been using its low commission and cheap locates to trade every single day. Also, I use routes to add liquidity which is a game changer to any trader to make money instead of paying commissions.

**6)    The markets gone sideways or down this year to date: has this caused any challenges you’ve had to overcome? If so, how?** 

Small caps have been very quiet this year, but it’s only February. Historically, March is the month everything starts to heat up again, and I will be prepared to add size to the opportunities that will arrise. My focus was not to find other setups if mine was quiet. Size down to the applicable volume and stay away from FOMO.

**7)    Where have you most saw opportunities this year?**

Short after hours small caps, but I’m biased :)
