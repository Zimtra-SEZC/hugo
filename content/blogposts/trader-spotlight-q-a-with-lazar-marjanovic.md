Balancing a love for the markets with life by the sea in Malta, [Lazar Marjanovic ](https://www.instagram.com/laza_plavi/) blends passion and discipline to refine strategies for volatile markets. With a commitment to learning, fitness, and exploring new destinations, he shares insights on his trading journey, strategies for success, and how Zimtra has been crucial in supporting his growth.

* **Tell us a little about yourself. Outside of trading, what do you enjoy doing? Are there any hobbies or routines that help you recharge and stay focused?**\
  \
  I’m passionate about everything related to stock trading and continually aim to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. My daily routines include studying the market, reading trading books, and refining my strategies. I also make fitness a priority, as hitting the gym helps me stay disciplined and focused. Living on the beautiful island of Malta, I enjoy hobbies related to the sea and traveling to explore new destinations. These activities, along with my dedication to personal and professional growth, keep me motivated for trading.
* **Lazar, you were recently at Zimtra’s first-ever Dubai Trading Exchange—how was the vibe?**\
  \
  Yes, I was at Zimtra’s Dubai event and it was one of the best events I've attended and I've been to many! There were unforgettable moments and I had the chance to make many new connections. Zimtra truly went above and beyond to host us at the highest level. I'm really looking forward to the next one!


* **What sparked your initial interest in trading and how did you evolve into the trader you are today?**\
  \
  I'm still early in my career, having started around 2018/19. However, things really started to pick up when I surrounded myself with the right people around 2022/23. Right now, I'm about to finish the SIE exam, and I plan to leverage those same connections to pursue the Series 6, 7, and 57 exams. My initial interest in trading was sparked by the opportunity to connect with like-minded people who shared a passion for the markets. From there, I hooked myself by reading books and studying anything related to the market. This combination of learning, networking, and relentless effort has been instrumental in shaping the trader I am today.



* **What’s working for you as a trader right now? Are there specific patterns, strategies or setups you focus on that give you an edge?**\
  \
  As a trader, I believe that evolution and adaptability are key to success. The markets are constantly changing, and every trader must adjust their strategies to stay ahead. Right now, I find that there’s always an edge to be found, especially in the volatile market we’re currently experiencing.



* **How did you discover your edge in trading and what adjustments did you make to get there?**\
  \
  I discovered my edge in trading by focusing on data collection and ensuring I had a clear understanding of what I was looking for and what should I ignore. Being part of a professional community was also crucial, but I made sure to join smaller, value-driven groups where accurate information is shared, and meaningful contributions can be made.



* **What makes Zimtra stand out and how have we supported your trading journey?**\
  \
  Zimtra stands out as an excellent way for day traders, whether trading long or short. As a short trader, I find Zimtra’s offerings particularly valuable. Zimtra provides exceptional customer support, access to locates, low fees, competitive rebates, and fast, direct executions, all of which are critical for executing my trading strategies effectively. These features have played a significant role in supporting my trading journey and helping me stay ahead in the market.



* **What advice would you share with traders who are just beginning their journey with Zimtra or exploring trading in general?**\
  \
  My advice to traders just starting with Zimtra or exploring trading in general is to avoid forcing any untested trades. It’s crucial to dedicate time - at least 10,000 hours - to study, read, listen to podcasts, and immerse yourself in learning. Surround yourself with experienced traders and attend conferences to gain deeper insights into the market. While you’re still in the beginning stages, use Zimtra’s support to help you develop the right habits and build a solid foundation for your trading journey.
